## About the Project

This project was created as my final for a course called Form & Code taught in the Art Studio & IDEAS (Integrated Design, Engineering & Applied Science) Department. I took this course in Spring of 2019, and it was taught by Christopher Chenier. 

The inspiration for this project began while completing a midterm project in which we used Rhinoceros and Grasshopper to make parametric objects. For this project, I used sine and cosine curves layered on top of each other to create intricate flowers. During the critique for this project, many expressed wanting to see this project in 3D. So, I went back to Processing and using a 3D FPS camera library QueasyCam, I made that a reality.
